In this guide you are going to create a multi-project build, with both a Grails application and a React front-end app, using the React profile for Grails.

This profile will generate two applications, `server` and `client`. `server` will be a Grails 3 application built using the `rest-api` profile, which includes support for creating domain resources, restful controllers, and JSON views. `client` is a standalone React app generated with the `create-react-app` CLI, with some customizations. The `client` app includes a complete UI implemented using React-Bootstrap, and is configured to communicate with the Grails backend via REST. The project also includes a functioning test suite and scripts for building and testing the app - see the `create-react-app` https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app[project documentation] for more information.
