This profile also defines a set of custom Gradle tasks, including a bootRun task to startup the client app. You can either start up the server and client apps separately:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew server:bootRun

//in another terminal
./gradlew client:start
----

The client `build.gradle` file also includes a `bootRun` (for consistency with the `server` project), which means  you can take advantage of Gradleâ€™s parallel execution to run both client and server apps in a single command:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew bootRun -parallel
----

Other tasks defined in client wrap the create-react-app scripts for building and testing the React app. You can run them with the Gradle wrapper, or run the npm scripts directly if you have npm installed.

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew client:test //or, from the client project dir: npm test

./gradlew client:build //or, from the client project dir: npm run build
----


Again, please see the create-react-app documentation for more information on leveraging these scripts and the other features provided by `create-react-app`.
